title: "Project 4: Investigation of Perturbation Methods for Boundary Layer Problems"
---
To introduce and explore perturbation methods specifically tailored for boundary layer problems commonly encountered in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and other areas of applied mathematics.
Boundary layer problems typically involve phenomena concentrated in a thin layer near a boundary, requiring specialized methods for accurate approximation.
Read **the section 2.5 Introduction to Boundary Layers** to study this problem.

1. Understanding Boundary Layers
Study the general features of boundary layer problems. 
Understand the concept of boundary layers and identify how and why they form in specific equations or systems, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow.

2. Mathematical Formulation
Identify a well-defined boundary layer problem. It could be in the context of fluid flow, heat transfer, or any other suitable domain. Formulate the governing equations and boundary conditions.
Example problem:
$$
\epsilon y'' + 2y' + 2y = 0, \quad \text{for } 0 < x < 1, \quad y(0)=0, \quad y(1) = 1
$$
where $ \epsilon $ is a small parameter representing the thickness of the boundary layer.

3. In the third step of the project, you are tasked with delving into perturbation methods, specifically focusing on regular perturbation and boundary layer methods, to solve the problem outlined in Step 2. For the regular perturbation component, you will formulate a series expansion for $ y(x) $ in terms of $ \epsilon $, followed by deriving the leading and next-order terms to understand the solution's behavior as $ \epsilon $ varies. Concurrently, using boundary layer methods, you will identify the location and width of the problem's boundary layer. By applying suitable variable transformations, they will derive both inner and outer solutions. These solutions will then be matched to generate a uniform approximation for $ y(x) $. This step aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how to apply these specialized techniques to solve complex problems effectively.
Should go through **the section 2.5 Introduction to Boundary Layers**.

4. In the fourth phase of the project, you will execute an in-depth error analysis to scrutinize the accuracy of the perturbative solutions, 
with a particular focus on studying how this error evolves with changes in $ \epsilon $. 
This analytical endeavor aims to achieve several educational outcomes: 
a comprehensive grasp of boundary layer phenomena and their mathematical repercussions, 
proficiency in applying perturbation techniques to boundary layer challenges, and insights into the limitations and effective applications of these methods. 
The evaluation of this work will hinge on multiple criteria, 
including the rigor and quality of mathematical derivations, 
the accuracy of numerical simulations, and the depth of the conducted error analysis. 
Through this multifaceted exercise, you are expected to deepen both their theoretical understanding and practical skills in perturbation methods, particularly within the context of boundary layer problems.

title: "Project 6: Fourier Transform for Solving Diffusion Equations"
---
Go through **the section 4.5 Fourier Transform** of the test book, have a report of the introduction of Fourier Transform for solving diffusion equations.
$$
u_t = Du_{xx}, \quad \text{for } -\infty < x < \infty, \quad 0 < t,
$$
with the initial condition
$$
u(x, 0) = f(x).
$$
It is assumed that $f(x)$ is piecewise continuous with $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pm\infty}f(x) = 0$.
Students choose this project should be able to understand the convolution theorem and how to solve the diffusion equation.

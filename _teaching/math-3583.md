### Course Description
This course introduces students to the foundations of applied mathematics, emphasizing both the analytical techniques and their numerical implementations.
Designed for undergraduate students with a solid understanding of calculus and differential equations,
the course offers a deep dive into topics ranging from the fundamentals of numerical linear algebra to the modeling of physical phenomena through kinetics, diffusion, and more.
Real-world applications will be showcased, 
providing students with a comprehensive understanding of how mathematical techniques are employed
in various fields. Python (jupyter notebook) will be employed as the primary computational tool,
making it a dual journey of mathematical rigor and computational exploration.

**By the end of this course, you will be able to:**
* Understand and apply Taylor expansion techniques to real-world problems.
* Solve complex problems using numerical linear algebra, appreciating the matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and transformations.
* Understand the fundamental principles of dimensionality reduction, applying them to real-world problems.
* Analyze and model dynamic systems with kinetics equations, understanding the underlying principles of chemical reactions, ecological dynamics, and conservation laws.
* Dive deep into the diffusion equation, grasping both discrete models like random walks and continuum theories.
* Understand the fundamental principles behind traffic flow, applying mathematical models to predict and analyze traffic dynamics.
* Tackle Laplacian equations in 2D, appreciating their significance and solving them using finite difference methods.

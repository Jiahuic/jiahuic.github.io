I am an assistant professor in the
Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas.
Prior to that I was a visiting assistant professor in the 
<a href="https://math.msu.edu/">Department of Mathematics at MSU</a> 
working with <a href="https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/">Prof. Guo-Wei Wei</a>. 
I have my Ph.D. at
<a href="https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/Math/Graduate/Dissertations-New">Southern Methodist University</a> in 2019
advised by <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/Math/People/Faculty/WeihuaGeng">Prof. Weihua Geng</a>.

My interests lie in finding the boundary that keeps mathematical beauty while doing machine learning.
My studies consist of mathematical studies, biology applications, 
and numerical algorithm developments. 
I am interested in developing topological and geometric data analysis methods 
for biology applications at molecular level, 
and the integration with machine learning and numerical partial differential equation (PDE). 
For biology, I am interested in problems of energy predictions of 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) and energy change predictions of PPI induced by mutations.
<!-- One of its key applications is  -->
<!-- studying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding against ACE2 and antibodies. -->
<!-- Therefore,  -->
<!-- the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and  -->
<!-- the efficacy of antibody therapies and vaccine can be analyzed. -->
In addition, I am also interested in 
fast computing of fast multipole methods (FMM), Treecode, parallel computing, 
and GPU accelerated computing. 

<!-- Before the current position at Michigan State University,  -->
<!-- I was a Ph.D. student at  -->
<!-- <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/Math/Graduate/Dissertations-New">Southern Methodist University</a> -->
<!-- advised by <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/Math/People/Faculty/WeihuaGeng">Prof. Weihua Geng</a> on my thesis -->
<!-- <a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/hum_sci_mathematics_etds/3/">Parallel multipole expansion algorithms and their biology applications</a>. -->
<!-- I studied the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and its boundary integral forms, -->
<!-- and applied boundary element methods accelerated with FMM and treecode method. -->
<!-- Moreover, I also studied the parallel computing of OpenMP and MPI in the implementation. -->

<!-- Currently, I put my efforts on developing mathematical methods of  -->
<!-- topology and geometry as data analysis for biology applications,  -->
<!-- and then use machine learning methods for biological property predictions. -->
<!-- I am also working on their applications to virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, etc. -->

#### My main research interests:

* Topological and geometric Data Analysis
* Treecode and Fast Multipole Method
* Machine Learning/Deep Learning
* Numerical PDB; Boundary Element Method
* Protein-Protein Interaction and Mutation Impacts
* SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine, and antibodies
<!-- * Differential Geometry -->

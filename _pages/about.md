I am a visiting assistant professor in the 
<a href="https://math.msu.edu/">Department of Mathematics at Michigan State University, East Lansing</a> 
with my mentor <a href="https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/">Prof. Guo-Wei Wei</a>. 
<b>My interests lie in finding the boundary that keeps mathematical beauty while doing machine learning.</b>
My studies consists of mathematical studies, biology applications, 
and numerical algorithm developments. 
I am interested in developing topological and geometric data analysis methods 
for biology applications at molecular level, 
and the integration with machine learning and numerical partial differential equation (PDE). 
For biology, I am interested in problems of energy predictions of 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) and energy change predictions of PPI induced by mutations.
One of its key applications is 
studying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding against ACE2 and antibodies.
Therefore, 
the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and 
the efficacy of antibody therapies and vaccine can be analyzed.
In addition, I am also interested in 
fast computing of fast multipole methods (FMM), Treecode, parallel computing, 
and GPU accelerated computing. 

Before the current position at Michigan State University, 
I was a Ph.D. student at 
<a href="https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/Math/Graduate/Dissertations-New">Southern Methodist University</a>
advised by <a href="https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/Math/People/Faculty/WeihuaGeng">Prof. Weihua Geng</a> on my thesis
<a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/hum_sci_mathematics_etds/3/">Parallel multipole expansion algorithms and their biology applications</a>.
I studied the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and its boundary integral forms,
and applied boundary element methods accelerated with FMM and treecode method.
Moreover, I also studied the parallel computing of OpenMP and MPI in the implementation.

Currently, I put my efforts on developing mathematical methods of 
topology and geometry as data analysis for biology applications, 
and then use machine learning methods for biological property predictions.
I am also working on their applications to virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, etc.

#### My main research interests:

* Topological Data Analysis
* Differential Geometry
* Protein-Protein Interaction and Mutation Impacts
* Treecode and Fast Multipole Method
* Machine Learning/Deep Learning
* Numerical PDB; Boundary Element Method
* SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine, and antibodies

  title={On preconditioning the treecode-accelerated boundary integral (TABI) Poisson--Boltzmann solver},
  author={Chen, Jiahui and Geng, Weihua},
  abstract={We recently developed a treecode-accelerated boundary integral (TABI) solver for solving Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation [1]. The solver has combined advantages in accuracy, efficiency, memory, and parallelization as it applies a well-posed boundary integral formulation to circumvent many numerical difficulties associated with the PB equation and uses an O(NlogN) treecode to accelerate the GMRES iterative solver. However, as observed in our previous work, occasionally when the mesh generator produces low quality triangles, the number of GMRES iterations required to solve the discretized boundary integral equations Ax=b could be large. To address this issue, we design a preconditioning scheme using preconditioner matrix M such that M^-1A has much improved condition while M^-1z can be rapidly computed for any vector z. In this scheme, the matrix M carries the interactions between boundary elements on the same leaf only in the tree structure thus is block diagonal with many computational advantages. The sizes of the blocks in M are conveniently controlled by the treecode parameter N0, the maximum number of particles per leaf. The numerical results show that this new preconditioning scheme improves the TABI solver with significantly reduced iteration numbers and better accuracy, particularly for protein sets on which TABI solver previously converges slowly. In addition, this preconditioning scheme potentially can improve the condition number of various multipole method accelerated boundary elements solvers in scattering, fluids, elasticity, etc.},

  author={Chen, Jiahui and Zhao, Rundong and Tong, Yiying and Wei, Guo-Wei},
  abstract={The de Rham-Hodge theory is a landmark of the 20th Century's mathematics and has had a great impact on mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. This work introduces an evolutionary de Rham-Hodge method to provide a unified  paradigm for the multiscale geometric and topological analysis of evolving manifolds constructed from a filtration, which induces a family of evolutionary de Rham complexes. While the present method can be easily applied to close manifolds,  the emphasis is given to more challenging compact manifolds with 2-manifold boundaries, which require appropriate analysis and treatment of boundary conditions on differential forms to maintain proper topological properties. Three sets of unique evolutionary Hodge Laplacians are proposed to generate three sets of topology-preserving singular spectra, for which the multiplicities of zero eigenvalues correspond to exactly the persistent Betti numbers of dimensions 0, 1, and 2. Additionally, three sets of non-zero eigenvalues further reveal both topological persistence and geometric progression during the manifold evolution.  Extensive numerical experiments are carried out via the discrete exterior calculus to demonstrate the potential of the proposed paradigm for data representation and shape analysis.  To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, application is considered to the protein B-factor predictions of a few challenging cases for which other existing models do not work well.},

  author={Chen, Jiahui and Geng, Weihua and Reynolds, Daniel R},
  abstract={We study the parallelization of a flexible order Cartesian treecode algorithm for evaluating electrostatic potentials of charged particle systems in which  particles are located on the molecular surfaces of biomolecules such as proteins. When the well-separated condition is satisfied, the treecode algorithm uses a far-field Taylor expansion to compute O(NlogN) particle–cluster interactions to replace the O(N^2) particle–particle interactions. The algorithm is implemented using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard by creating identical tree structures in the memory of each task for concurrent computing. We design a cyclic order scheme to uniformly distribute spatially-closed target particles to all available tasks, which significantly improves parallel load balancing. We also investigate the parallel efficiency subject to treecode parameters such as Taylor expansion order p, maximum particles per leaf N0, and maximum acceptance criterion theta. This cyclically parallelized treecode can solve interactions among up to tens of millions of particles. However, if the problem size exceeds the memory limit of each task, a scalable domain decomposition (DD) parallelized treecode using an orthogonal recursive bisection (ORB) tree can be used instead In addition to efficiently computing the N-body problem of charged particles, our approach can potentially accelerate GMRES iterations for solving the boundary integral Poisson–Boltzmann equation.},

  abstract={Despite tremendous efforts in the past two years, our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), virus–host interactions, immune response, virulence, transmission, and evolution is still very limited. This limitation calls for further in-depth investigation. Computational studies have become an indispensable component in combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to their low cost, their efficiency, and the fact that they are free from safety and ethical constraints. Additionally, the mechanism that governs the global evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be revealed from individual experiments and was discovered by integrating genotyping of massive viral sequences, biophysical modeling of protein–protein interactions, deep mutational data, deep learning, and advanced mathematics. There exists a tsunami of literature on the molecular modeling, simulations, and predictions of SARS-CoV-2 and related developments of drugs, vaccines, antibodies, and diagnostics. To provide readers with a quick update about this literature, we present a comprehensive and systematic methodology-centered review. Aspects such as molecular biophysics, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, machine learning, and mathematics are discussed. This review will be beneficial to researchers who are looking for ways to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 studies and those who are interested in the status of the field.},

  title={Prediction and mitigation of mutation threats to COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies},
  author={Chen, Jiahui and Gao, Kaifu and Wang, Rui and Wei, Guo-Wei},
  abstract={Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end the raging COVID-19 pandemic. They, however, are prone to over 5000 mutations on the spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation Tracker based on over 200 000 genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations will impact vaccines and antibodies in development. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of the 462 mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 antibody disrupting mutants is identified, while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that about 65% of the existing RBD mutations, including those variants recently found in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, will strengthen the binding between the S protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in more infectious COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparity between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFE strengthening and weakening of the bindings with antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the human immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery, unfortunately, implies the vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Our predictions were validated by comparison with more than 1400 deep mutations on the S protein RBD. Our results show the urgent need to develop new mutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies and to prepare for seasonal vaccinations.},
